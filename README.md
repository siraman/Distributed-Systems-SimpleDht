# Distributed-Systems
Designed a simple DHT based on Chord. Although the design is based on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord; finger tables and finger-based routing is not implemented; handle node leaves/failures are also not implemented. Therefore, there are three things that were implement: 
1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning, 
2) Ring-based routing, and 
3) Node joins.
